# Bitnion (BNO) ‚Äì Post-Build Installation Script
#
# This script installs Bitnion Core binaries and headers after a successful build.
# It ensures that all output components are placed consistently across the project tree,
# and that required files are available for downstream usage (e.g., packaging or deployment).
#
# Fully adapted from Bitcoin Core CI pipelines, rewritten for Bitnion project integration.
#
# Affected modules: chainparams, pow.cpp, validation.cpp, README.md, etc.
