# Bitnion (BNO) ‚Äì Pre-Installation Script for Build Environment Setup
#
# This script prepares the system prior to building Bitnion Core.
# It ensures that all dependencies and environment assumptions are validated
# before invoking the configure and make stages.
#
# Adapted from the Bitcoin Core CI suite and rewritten to fully support
# the Bitnion project structure, naming, and source code layout.
#
# Relevant modules: chainparams, pow.cpp, validation.cpp, README.md, etc.
