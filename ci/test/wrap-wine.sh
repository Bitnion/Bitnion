# Bitnion (BNO) ‚Äì Wine Execution Wrapper for Windows Binaries
#
# This script wraps the execution of cross-compiled Bitnion Windows binaries
# using Wine. It allows seamless testing of .exe builds generated via
# MinGW (e.g., x86_64-w64-mingw32) on Unix-like systems.
#
# Adapted from Bitcoin Core infrastructure, rewritten for the Bitnion project.
