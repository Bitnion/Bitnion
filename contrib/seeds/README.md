# Bitnion Seed Nodes

This directory contains scripts and data files used for generating and maintaining DNS seed nodes for the Bitnion (BNO) network.

---

## üìÅ Files in This Directory

- `generate-seeds.py`  
  Script to fetch, clean, and sort reachable nodes from known peer sources.

- `makeseeds.py`  
  Generates hardcoded seed list entries to be added into the `chainparams.cpp` source file.

- `nodes_main.txt`  
  Raw list of reachable mainnet nodes discovered from Bitnion peer-to-peer connections.

- `nodes_test.txt`  
  List of nodes collected from testnet environments.

- `suspicious_hosts.txt`  
  Optional list to manually exclude malicious or suspicious IPs during seed generation.

## üîÑ How to Use

1. **Gather Node Data**  
   Update `nodes_main.txt` and `nodes_test.txt` by crawling the network using your own crawler or trusted peers.

2. **Run Scripts**  
   Use:
   ```bash
   python3 generate-seeds.py
   python3 makeseeds.py

This will generate sanitized, deduplicated node entries for DNS seeding.

Update Source Code
Insert the generated seed entries into src/chainparams.cpp, like:
vSeeds.emplace_back("seed.bitnion.org");
Test Network Consistency
Make sure seed entries are live, properly ported (default 9333), and adhere to Bitnion‚Äôs consensus rules.
