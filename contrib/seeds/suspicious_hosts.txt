# Bitnion (BNO) – Suspicious Hosts List
#
# This file contains a list of IP addresses or DNS entries that should be
# excluded from seed node generation. These entries may be associated with:
#
# ▪ Malicious activity (e.g. spamming, flooding, double-spending)
# ▪ Misconfigured nodes that relay invalid blocks or transactions
# ▪ Known Sybil attacks or DoS sources
# ▪ Nodes violating Bitnion’s protocol consistency or block rules
#
# This list is manually maintained by the Bitnion Core Team and contributors.
# It is consulted by both `generate-seeds.py` and `makeseeds.py` scripts
# to prevent inclusion of bad actors in the hardcoded DNS seeds.
#
# Format: one IP address or domain per line.
# Comments begin with '#' and are ignored.

# Example entries:
185.199.110.153
212.47.229.1
fake-node.badactor.com
10.0.0.0/8
192.168.0.0/16

# Suspicious patterns (optional):
# *.tor-exit-node.org
# *.vpn-no-logging.net

# NOTE:
# Do not add peers here based on opinion or geography.
# Only add if there is clear evidence or multiple incidents reported.
