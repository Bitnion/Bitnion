# Bitnion (BNO) â€“ Allowed Reversible Signature Commits
#
# This file lists Git commits that include reversible signatures (revsig)
# which are not compatible with deterministic SHA512 commit verification,
# but have been manually reviewed and approved by the Bitnion Core Team.
#
# Revsig commits may contain metadata or signature changes that do not
# alter functional code or build outputs, but cause verification to fail.
#
# Format: One commit hash (SHA1 or SHA512) per line
# Used by: contrib/verify-commits/verify-commits.py

# Example approved revsig commits:

111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff0000
aaaa0000bbbb1111cccc2222dddd3333eeee4444ffff55556666777788889999

# WARNING:
# Do not add commit hashes here without full audit and team consensus.
# Every exception weakens deterministic reproducibility.
