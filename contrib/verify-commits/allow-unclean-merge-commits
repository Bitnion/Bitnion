# Bitnion (BNO) â€“ Allowed Unclean Merge Commits
#
# This file lists Git commits that represent "unclean" merges (e.g., merge commits
# with unrelated histories or conflicts) which have been reviewed and approved.
#
# Normally, the Bitnion verification process only accepts clean, linear history.
# However, in rare cases, legacy or upstream merges may violate this rule.
#
# Each line should contain a single commit hash that is known, reviewed,
# and accepted by the Bitnion Core Team.

# Example unclean merge commits:

123abc456def789ghi000aaa111bbb222ccc333ddd444eee555fff666ggg777

# DO NOT add entries here unless:
# - The merge commit was reviewed thoroughly.
# - The deviation from clean history was intentional.
# - All developers involved have agreed on its inclusion.
