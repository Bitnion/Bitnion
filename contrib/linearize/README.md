# Bitnion Blockchain Linearization Tools

This directory provides scripts used to **extract and linearize the Bitnion blockchain data** into a format suitable for explorers, archival systems, or deterministic backups.

These tools are adapted from Bitcoin Core and modified for full compatibility with Bitnion's blockchain structure and naming conventions.
