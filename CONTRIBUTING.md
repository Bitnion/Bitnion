# 🤝 Contributing to Bitnion (BNO)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Bitnion project.

Bitnion is a community-driven, non-commercial cryptocurrency inspired by the original Bitcoin Core codebase, built with the same security, consensus, and decentralized principles — and enhanced with ethical premine distribution.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- ✅ 100% open-source and MIT licensed  
- ✅ No ICO, no token sale, no centralized control  
- ✅ Community-first, fair launch in 2025  
- ✅ Technical parity with Bitcoin Core (90–98%)  
- ✅ Premine transparently distributed to real users and early miners

We welcome contributions from developers, miners, researchers, and educators who believe in open, fair financial systems.
