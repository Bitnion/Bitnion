# Bitnion (BNO) – Premine Distribution & Community Support Policy

As part of the Genesis Block, 1,000,000 BNO have been premined by the Bitnion Core Team. The distribution policy includes:

## 🎯 Distribution Plan

1. Bitnion is a community-driven, open-source cryptocurrency developed without any commercial funding.

2. 950,000 BNO are allocated to early supporters and miners under the following conditions:
   - ✅ 1 BNO to each verified KYC wallet holder (free and voluntary)
   - ✅ 1 additional BNO for any verified miner who mines at least 5 BNO during the early phase

3. KYC verification is processed within 3–14 days by the Bitnion Core Team via: **bitnion@gmail.com**

4. The team maintains 10 secured central wallets to manage premine distribution.

5. 50,000 BNO are reserved exclusively for internal use by the anonymous developer team, to honor their 1-year contribution.

6. The Bitnion Team **does not and will never sell or offer BNO tokens commercially.**

7. Bitnion is not an investment, security, or financial product.

## 💝 Optional Community Support (Tremendous)

Supporters who wish to help the Bitnion Core Team via donation platforms (e.g. Tremendous, voucher-based) may voluntarily receive symbolic thank-you gifts from the team:

- $10–20 USD → thank-you gift of **5 BNO**
- $30–40 USD → thank-you gift of **10 BNO**

🎯 Important:
- These are **symbolic gifts**, not sales.
- This is **not a token exchange**.
- Gifts are subject to availability and will stop once central reserve drops below **50,000 BNO**.

## 🔄 Future Listing Policy

8. If Bitnion is ever listed on a major cryptocurrency exchange, the Bitnion Core Team will welcome and support the development with transparency and neutrality.

9. If holders, supporters, and miners unite in efforts toward official exchange listings, the Bitnion Core Team will remain supportive of such community-driven initiatives — provided they comply with relevant laws and ethics.
